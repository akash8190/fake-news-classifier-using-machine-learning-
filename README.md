In this project we simply classify the fake news using machine learning algorithm .It is also the part of nlp project .

## project overview

One of the most widely used natural language processing task in different business problems is “Text Classification”. The goal of text classification is to automatically classify the text documents/text into one or more defined categories. Some examples of text classification are:
a) Understanding audience sentiment from social media,
b) Detection of spam and non-spam emails,
c) Auto tagging of customer queries, and
d) Categorization of news articles into defined topics.
e) Fake/Genuine news classification

In this project we simply analyze or detect fake news with the help of machine learning algoritham
